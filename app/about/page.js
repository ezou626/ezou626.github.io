    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Eric Zou. I'm pursuing a BSE in Computer Science (and hopefully an Accelerated Master's in Computer Science) at the University of Pennsylvania intending to graduate in 2026. I'm interested in software development, AI/ML, and embedded systems as a means to bring useful technology to the general public.</p>
